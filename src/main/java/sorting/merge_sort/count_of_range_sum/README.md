# Count of Range Sum

[AlgoMaster Problem](https://algomaster.io/learn/dsa/count-of-range-sum)  
[LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-range-sum/)

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i <= j`.

---

#### Example 1:

> Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2  
Output: 3

#### Example 2:

> Input: nums = [0], lower = 0, upper = 0  
Output: 1

---

#### Constraints:

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
* `-10^5 <= lower <= upper <= 10^5`
* The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
